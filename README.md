🚀 JavaScript Fundamentals Assignment

This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts including variables, conditionals, functions, loops, and DOM manipulation. It is structured into four main parts, each showcasing practical use cases for building interactive web pages.

📂 Project Structure
/javascript-fundamentals-assignment
  ├── index.html   # Structured HTML content
  ├── style.css    # Basic styling (optional)
  └── script.js    # JavaScript code (logic + DOM)

🎯 Part 1: JavaScript Basics

Declared variables (userName, age)

Used if/else conditionals to check age status

Logged results using console.log()

Goal: Understand how JavaScript handles variables, logic, and output.

❤️ Part 2: JavaScript Functions

calculateTotal(price, quantity) → calculates total cost of items.

formatGreeting(name) → formats and returns a custom greeting string.

Goal: Learn reusability through custom functions (DRY principle).

🔁 Part 3: JavaScript Loops

For loop → logs numbers 1–5.

While loop → simple countdown from 3.

Goal: Practice iteration and repetition for dynamic tasks.

🌐 Part 4: DOM Manipulation

Toggle Greeting → button toggles text content of a <p> element.

Dynamic List → generates a fruit list (Apple, Banana, Cherry) dynamically.

Countdown Timer → button triggers a countdown displayed on the page.

Goal: Demonstrate how JavaScript makes static HTML interactive.

🛠️ How to Run

Download or clone this project folder.

Open index.html in your browser.

Open Developer Console (F12) to view console logs from Part 1–3.

Interact with buttons to test DOM features.

✅ Outcomes

Clear understanding of variables, conditionals, functions, and loops.

Hands-on practice with DOM manipulation for interactivity.

Organized, readable, and well-commented JavaScript code.
